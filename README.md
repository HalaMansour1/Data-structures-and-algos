# Data-structures-and-algos
This repository showcases various projects developed as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms course. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in implementing and optimizing fundamental data structures and algorithms, including binary search trees (BST), B-trees, AVL trees, hash tables, and more.
